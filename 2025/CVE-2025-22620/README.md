# checkout-index - Reproducer for CVE-2025-22620

This is the proof of concept code for [RUSTSEC-2025-0001](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0001.html) (CVE-2025-22620, [GHSA-fqmf-w4xh-33rh](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-fqmf-w4xh-33rh). It is the same code as in the advisory, but in the form of a Rust project, with `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` included.

The `main` branch has the version of the code presented in step 2 of the advisory, while the `unaffected-case` branch has the modification described in step 7 to show the effect of explicitly setting `destination_is_initially_empty: true`.

This repo was useful while writing the advisory, and I figured it might occasionally be useful to others. However, I expect this to be of much less interest than the advisory, and also this is not a substitute for the information in the advisory. As noted in the advisory, the vulnerability is fixed in `gix-worktree-state` 0.17.0.
